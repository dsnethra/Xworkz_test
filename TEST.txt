1] datatatype variablename;

2] no

3] yes

4] yes

5]

6]no

7] yes 

8]yes

9]int arr[4]={1,2,3,4};

10] o/p is= this is array element array[n] array[n-1] array[n-2].........array[1]

11] * write the program on the java script
    * save with file_name.java extension
    * open command prompt
    *take acces to your path give command javac file_name.java
    *if no error give command java main method file_name

12] javac is nothing but java compiler used to convert source code in byte code
    java is nothing but a programing language here we write set of instruction to perform some task


13]   It loads classes from different resources. Java ClassLoader is used to load the classes at run time.  JVM performs the linking process at runtime. Classes are loaded into the JVM 
      according to need. If a loaded class depends on another class, that class is loaded as well. When we request to load a class, it delegates the class to its parent.
  
14]    if n is the size of the array. If a request for  an index greater than or equal to the size of the array is made, then the JAVA throws an ArrayIndexOutOfBounds  
      Exception


15] why bcz java has primitive data types these datatypes are not pure objects

16] jdk=java development kit  it provides the platform to execute java program
    jre= java run time environment it is a set of software instruction used to drive other software application
    jvm= java virtual machine it doesn't physically exist. It is a specification that provides a runtime environment in which Java bytecode can be executed. It can also run those programs   
    which are written in other languages and compiled to Java bytecode.

17] new constructor

18]yes

19] it means it is platform independent, bcz of its byte code

20] creation of own method

21] java virtual machine it doesn't physically exist. It is a specification that provides a runtime environment in which Java bytecode can be executed. It can also run those programs   
    which are written in other languages and compiled to Java bytecode.

22] each class has its own state and behaviour
    state is nothing but variable (static variable=class   non static variable=instance)
    behaviour is nothing but method(static method and non statis method)

23] causal argument
    rebustal argument
    proposal argument
    formal argument
    actual argument

24]

25]  variable is that holds the value 

26]  heap

27]  assigning value to the decalred variable

28] 

29]int variable,string variable,double variable etc..

30] convert the byte code into machine code

32] WORA = write once run anywhere

33] go to commsand prompt
   type "java-version"

34] latest version 17 LTS on the Java SE Platform.

35] class is blue print of an object(instance)

36] object is nothing but instances of an class

37] class class_name{}

38] static void method_name(object){}

39] constructor is a method ,special method bcz it is always joines with new keyword
    used to create copy of the class
    and used to initialize the instance variable during execution
